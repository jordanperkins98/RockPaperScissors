Iâ€™m using this project as a refresher on web development. The project is a simple rock paper scissors game, the logic is written in JavaScript and the UI is written in HTML and CSS. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be found [here](https://jordanperkins98.github.io/RockPaperScissors/).

I started off only creating the game in the console, but I wanted to add a UI to make it more user friendly. 

## What I learned
- How to use the DOM to manipulate HTML elements
- How to use event listeners to listen for user input
- How to use functions to create reusable code
- How to use the Math.random() function to generate a random number

## What I could improve
- The UI is very basic and could be improved
- The code could be refactored to be more efficient
- The code could be refactored to be more readable
